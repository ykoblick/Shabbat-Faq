### General:

1. Why does Shabbat.com require so much personal information like my address and phone number?

    * Shabbat.com assists hosts and guests connecting for Shabbat. In order to properly allow
      a guest to find a home for Shabbat, Shabbat.com provides a close approximation of the Host's location.
      Shabbat.com never displays any guest's or host's address or phone number.

2.  The website doesn't work well for me on my phone or tablet.

    * Experiencing all the rich and immersive features of Shabbat.com on a mobile device is best accomplished by installing our mobile app.
    The app is available for both iOS and Android. The mobile site is fully supported but experience better on the app!

### Privacy:

1.  How do I block an individual from bothering me?

    * Any member that you are not comfortable with can be blocked. If you block another member they cannot:
        - message you
        - invite or request hosting
        - friend you

        Note: All previous messages and invites disappear automatically on the site.

        To block a member on the website, here are 4 ways to initiate it:

        - Navigate to their profile, click on the 'About' tab (under the cover image in the center of the page).
          Then click on 'Member Blocking' and click on the 'block' button.

        - Click on the 'Gear' icon menu item in the header of any inner page (on the left). This opens the privacy
          settings menu. Click on the item that says 'Stop someone from bothering me'. There you can type the name
          of the member you wish to block and eventually block them.

        - On any conversation in your messages page, there is a settings menu (identified by a 'gear' icon).
          There is a menu option for blocking the member in your conversation. This option is helpful in case someone
          messages you and upon receiving their message you wish to immediately block them.

        - Any invite email, friend email, or message email contains a prominent link to take action and block the member.



2.  How do I prevent people from messaging me?

  * In your privacy settings you can specify that you don't want to be contacted. In the header menu area on the far right, click on
  the 'gear' icon. The first menu item is 'Who can message me?'. There you have multiple options for being messaged.

  The app contains the same possibilities. On your home screen, swipe to the right. Select 'Privacy Shortcuts'.
